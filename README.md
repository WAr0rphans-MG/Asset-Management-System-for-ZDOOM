# Asset-Management-System-for-ZDOOM
Real-time asset customization system for GZDoom. Swap health/armor pickup sprites instantly via in-game menus with preset and custom modes. Showcases architectural evolution from ACS/DECORATE with Legacy files to ZScript incorporation across iterations from 2022-2023, then resumed and refined in late 2025-2026.

## Note on Assets

This repository contains only the code and logic (ACS, DECORATE, ZScript, menu definitions). 
Sprite assets are not included but will be available when a playable mod release is published.

To use this code in your own projects, you'll need to provide your own sprites or substitute 
the sprite names in the DECORATE files.
