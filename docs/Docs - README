# Documentation

*Created February 2025 with Claude AI assistance*

---

## Overview

This folder contains detailed documentation of the Alternative Medical Symbol system's development journey, architectural evolution, and learning process.

While the component READMEs (acs/, decorate/, zscript/, misc/) focus on **what changed** in each version, these documents explore **why**, **how**, and **what was learned**.

---

## Contents

### [timeline.md](timeline.md)
**Chronological breakdown of development**

Detailed timeline from August 2022 through February 2026, including:
- Exact dates from preserved files
- Development context and motivations
- Gaps and dormancy periods
- Active development vs refinement phases

**Read this to understand:** When things happened and what drove each phase of work.

---

### [architecture-evolution.md](architecture-evolution.md)
**Technical progression and design decisions**

Deep dive into architectural thinking across versions:
- Pattern discoveries and adaptations
- Scalability improvements
- Why certain approaches were chosen over others
- Trade-offs and compromises

**Read this to understand:** The technical reasoning behind design decisions and how the architecture matured.

---

### [learning-journey.md](learning-journey.md)
**Personal reflections and meta-lessons**

The human side of the development process:
- Learning from zero programming knowledge
- Self-teaching strategies that worked
- Dealing with failures and dead ends
- Modern development workflows (AI assistance)
- Breaking the 15-year pattern of unfinished projects

**Read this to understand:** What it's like to learn GZDoom modding from scratch and how this project became a case study in self-directed learning.

## How To Read This Documentation

**For Learning GZDoom Modding:**
1. Start with [learning-journey.md](learning-journey.md) - See the path from zero to working systems
2. Read component READMEs (../acs/, ../decorate/, etc.) - Understand what evolved
3. Dive into [architecture-evolution.md](architecture-evolution.md) - Learn why it evolved that way
4. Reference [timeline.md](timeline.md) - See the chronological context

**For Technical Reference:**
1. Start with [architecture-evolution.md](architecture-evolution.md) - Understand design patterns
2. Reference component READMEs for specific implementations
3. Check [timeline.md](timeline.md) for development context
4. Read [learning-journey.md](learning-journey.md) for meta-lessons

**For Portfolio Review:**
1. Main README (../) - Project overview and scope
2. [learning-journey.md](learning-journey.md) - Demonstrates learning capacity
3. [architecture-evolution.md](architecture-evolution.md) - Shows technical thinking
4. Component READMEs - Proves execution ability

## Documentation Philosophy

**This documentation is intentionally:**

### Honest
- Shows failures alongside successes
- Admits uncertainty where it exists
- Transparent about AI assistance
- Doesn't hide the messy iteration process

### Educational
- Explains the "why" not just the "what"
- Includes dead ends and mistakes
- Shows thought process and decision-making
- Written for someone learning, not just using

### Complete
- Preserves all versions (including failed ones)
- Documents gaps in preservation
- Acknowledges what's unclear or forgotten
- Provides context for every major decision

### Accessible
- Assumes reader is learning GZDoom modding
- Explains technical concepts clearly
- Connects to broader programming principles
- Written in plain language with examples

## Target Audiences

**New GZDoom Modders:**
- See realistic learning path from zero knowledge
- Understand iteration and failure are normal
- Get working code to study and adapt
- Learn documentation best practices

**Experienced Developers:**
- Reference implementation of clean patterns
- Architectural insights for their own systems
- Example of thorough documentation approach
- Case study in self-directed learning

**Potential Employers:**
