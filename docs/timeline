# Development Timeline

*Code: W@r0rphans (2022-2026) | Documentation: Created February 2025 with Claude AI assistance*

---

## Overview

This timeline reconstructs the Alternative Medical Symbol system's development from preserved file dates, code analysis, and memory. Gaps exist where files were overwritten during active development.

**Total active development: ~6 weeks** spread across two intensive periods (2022 and 2025-2026), separated by a 3-year dormancy.

---

## Pre-History: The Mod Merger Origins

### Mid-August 2022
**Goal:** Merge two GZDoom mods for personal use
- RVDoomVox (voxel model support)
- Delashin's Smooth Doom Remake (enhanced gameplay/visuals)

**Planned customizations:**
- Replace DOOM 64 sprites with higher-quality DOOM 64 Community Edition versions
- Add missing DOOM 64 weapons (fists, plasma rifle, BFG)
- Ensure voxel compatibility
- Custom sprite replacements

**The spark:** Discovered real-time routing patterns in DSD Remake's weapon states (CVars checked every frame for attachment switching). Realized this could apply to health pickups.

**What started as mod merging** became an exploration of dynamic asset customization systems.

---

## Phase 1: v0 Development (August-September 2022)

### August 22, 2022
**Last file WITHOUT v0 features** (pre-v0 baseline)
- Mod merging work in progress
- No medical symbol system yet
- DOOM 64 CE sprite replacement work underway

### August 22 - September 5, 2022
**Active v0 development begins** (~2 weeks)
- Files from this period overwritten during development (not preserved)
- Learning ACS from scratch (zero programming knowledge)
- Reverse-engineering DSD Remake's decompiled scripts
- Discovering DECORATE real-time routing pattern
- Creating custom voxels (majority self-made)
- Trial and error on routing logic

**Known milestone - September 5, 2022:**
- Medikits and Stimpacks real-time routing complete
- Working button-based preset system (KEYCONF)

### September 5-14, 2022
**Completing v0** (~1.5 weeks)
- Berserk routing nearly complete (missing explicit Pickup state - added later)
- ArmorID tracking system initial implementation
- SBARINFO HUD integration
- DOOM 64 plasma rifle and BFG ports with accurate timing

**Known issue preserved:** Tan-gloved pistol holdover from DSD Remake (requires weapon fire/switch to revert to vanilla sprite)

### September 18, 2022
**v0 COMPLETE - PK3 final packaging**

**What worked:**
- Real-time sprite routing (continuous checking + looping)
- Button-based presets (KEYCONF aliases)
- Individual item customization (medtoggle, stmtoggle, brztoggle CVars)
- Override behavior (buttons worked in both preset and custom modes)
- Complete integration (HUD, armor tracking, all items)

**Total v0 development time: ~4 weeks active work**

---

## Phase 2: v1-v3a Sprint (October 2022)

### September 18 - October 17, 2022
**Dormancy (~1 month)**
- v0 worked perfectly
- No code changes to medical symbol system
- Continued work on broader mod (weapons, voxels, integration)

### October 17-20, 2022
**v1 Development Begins** (3-4 days)

**Goal:** Replace v0's working KEYCONF buttons with dropdown menus for visual consistency

**October 17:** v1 development starts
- Exploring "smart getter" approach (getters check mode and return appropriate value)

**October 20:** First preserved ACS script file
- v1 attempt 1: Smart getters with unclear failure reason (possibly name conflicts)
- v1 attempt 2: Central preset script with duplicate conditions and flow control issues

**Between Oct 17-20:** Multiple iterations, most files overwritten

**v1-successful achieved** (preserved in v2 comments):
- Compound conditions working (`Preset==X && Master==Y`)
- Clean preset/custom mode separation
- Variables for readability
- **Limitation:** No overlap - preset dropdown doesn't work in custom mode (lost v0 button override behavior)

**Learning:** Flow control fundamentals, GetUserCVar vs GetCVar distinction, when/how scripts execute

---

### October 24, 2022
**INTENSE EXPERIMENTATION DAY** 🔥

**The problem:** Restore v0's button override behavior (preset changes should work in custom mode too)

**Multiple parallel attempts:**
- **v2a (attempt 1):** First approach to overlap logic
- **v3:** Consolidation attempt
- **v3b:** Refinement of v3
- **v3b1:** Further refinement
- **v3a (attempt 1):** First exploration of router + worker pattern
- **v3a (attempt 2):** Second attempt same day

**All failed, but exploration building toward breakthrough**

**What this shows:** Sometimes you need to try EVERYTHING to find what works. Not linear progress, but exhaustive search.

---

### October 25-26, 2022
**v2 Continued Refinements** (2 days)

**October 25:**
- v2a attempt 2: Different logic approach

**October 26:**
- v2a attempt 3 (final): Dual-script system (SYMPreset + SYMCustomPreset)
- Added Delay + Restart loop (learning!)
- Preset mode works correctly
- Custom mode has broken nested logic (Preset==1 checked inside Preset==0 block - unreachable code)

**Key learning:** Loops and continuous execution, but still struggling with overlap logic

---

### October 27, 2022
**v3-alpha BREAKTHROUGH** ✨

**The router + worker pattern that finally works!**
SYMPreset (Router):
Checks pretoggle value
Calls appropriate worker script
Workers (SYMRed, SYMGreen, SYMPills):
Check Master toggle
Preset mode: Set all CVars
Custom mode, same preset: Do nothing (preserve custom values)
Custom mode, different preset: Set CVars (quick-set!)
**Why it works:**
- Separation of concerns (routing vs logic)
- Each worker handles one preset
- State checking allows overlap behavior
- Clean, understandable structure

**AFTER 10 DAYS OF ITERATION (Oct 17-27), PRESET/CUSTOM OVERLAP ACHIEVED!** 🎉

**Total v1-v3a development: 10 days** (Oct 17-27, 2022)

---

## Phase 3: Continued Development (Late 2022 - 2023)

### October 2022 - September/October 2023
**Focus shifts to broader mod integration**
- Medical symbol system functionally complete (v3-alpha working)
- Continued work on weapons, voxels, sprite replacements
- ArmorID refinements:
  - ArmorID v2 (October 2022) - Added Megasphere support
  - ArmorID v2.5 (September 24, 2023) - Further refinements

**Medical symbol system: STABLE, no major changes**

---

## Phase 4: The Long Dormancy (October 2023 - December 2025)

### ~3 Years: No Code Work
- Medical symbol system untouched
- Broader mod work also paused
- Other life priorities
- Pattern of unfinished projects continuing

**The 15-year pattern:** Starting projects, getting them working, then abandoning before documentation/release

---

## Phase 5: Return and Refinement (December 2025 - February 2026)

### December 30, 2025
**Returned to project after 3-year break**

**Immediate observations:**
- v3-alpha worked but code was repetitive
- Scalability issues (adding 4th preset = lots of duplicated code)
- Could be consolidated

**v4 Development (minutes):**
- Consolidated worker logic (replaced explicit checks with `Preset != X` pattern)
- More scalable (adding preset = one condition change)
- Verified functional
- **Never actively used** - v5 completed immediately after

**v5 Development with Microsoft Copilot** (same day, <1 hour total):

**Initial architecture generation:**
- Copilot generated unified worker with state memory pattern
- Arrays for tracking, detection logic

**Iterative debugging (mental/conversational, no execution):**
1. Identified initialization bug (would override custom setups on first load)
2. Removed unnecessary arrays (preset value IS the value!)
3. Simplified logic through conversation
4. Added getter scripts back for DECORATE integration
5. **5-6 iterations from concept to working code**

**What emerged:**
```c
int LastPreset = -1;  // Global state memory

script "SYMWorker" (void)
{
    if (LastPreset == -1) LastPreset = Preset;  // Initialize
    
    if (Master == 0) { /* preset mode */ }
    else if (Master == 1 && Preset == LastPreset) { /* do nothing */ }
    else if (Master == 1 && Preset != LastPreset) { /* quick-set */ }
    
    LastPreset = Preset;  // Update memory
}
Total v4-v5 development: ~3 hours (both versions, same day)
January 2026
v5 Refinements and Expansion
January 27, 2026:
Final v5 ACS edits and verification
January 28, 2026:
DECORATE architectural refactors (both versions in ~1-2 hours)
First refactor: Factory + color variants
Master routes by color
Each color variant is separate actor
Scales better than v0-v4 (add color = 1 new actor)
Second refactor: Factory + style variants
Master routes by style (1993 vs DOOM 64)
Style actors route by color internally
Further optimization (2 style actors vs 4+ color actors)
Best achievable pattern in DECORATE
ZScript Integration (same day):
Generated by Copilot/Gemini based on requirements:
AMSOptionsMenu.zs - Real-time menu preview
Ticker override runs during menu
Calls ACS when preset changes
Refreshes display to show updates
Bug discovered during Feb 2026 documentation: cv.GetInt() vs as.GetInt() (copy-paste error)
AMSArmorHandler.zs - Event-driven armor tracking
Replaces looping ACS ArmorID system
Property-based detection (not hardcoded class names)
~40 lines vs ~100+ in ACS
Automatic multi-player support
AMSFullScreenHUD.zs - Complete HUD replacement
Replaces ~300 line SBARINFO
Programmatic drawing with full control
Custom scaling per sprite
Modern GZDoom standard
Total January 2026 work: ~1 day active development
February 2026

What's unclear:
Exact failure reasons for v1 attempts (logic appears sound years later)
Complete picture of Oct 24 parallel experimentation
When certain insights occurred (file dates only show checkpoints)
Preserved well:
v0 final (Sept 18)
v1 attempts 1-2 (Oct 20)
v1-successful (in v2 comments)
v2a attempts (Oct 24-26)
v3-alpha final (Oct 27)
v4-v5 (Dec 2025)
All ZScript (Jan 2026)
Development Patterns
Iterative bursts:
Not steady progress, but intensive periods
v0: 4 weeks of focused learning
v1-v3a: 10 days of rapid iteration
v4-v5: Hours of refinement (experience + AI assistance)
Long dormancy:
3 years between active work
Pattern of starting but not finishing (15 years)
Return enabled by clear deadline and documentation focus
Learning acceleration:
v0: 4 weeks (learning everything)
v1-v3a: 10 days (understanding patterns)
v4-v5: Hours (mastery + AI collaboration)
Each phase built on previous understanding - couldn't have done v5 without v0-v3a struggles.
